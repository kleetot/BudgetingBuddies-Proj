# BudgetingBuddies-Proj
Human-Computer Interaction was a class that focused on the accessibility of websites. The goal of the final project is to create a website according to the specifications we learned in class, starting from user stories and story boards to prototypes to final evaluations. The final evaluations included laws of simplicity, error consideration, heuristic evaluation, tidwell patterns, and microinteractions. All of these evaluations are covered in the slideshow.

The files include
1. A Slideshow which describes the goal of the website, potential competitors, industry data, a survey, a persona created from the data, the target population, prototypes, user feedback, initial html outline, our figma design, and the final product.
2. The Code (in HTML and CSS)
   
We also created a demo video that is too large to be uploaded to GitHub.

We all contributed equally, although most of my effort related to the Figma prototype, final HTML pages, and the slideshow. I also created most of the questions (and question pages) in the quiz, as well as configuring the buttons in each quiz question. I also created the FAQ page.

This class was very useful in learning how to create accessible interfaces. This was the first class I needed to use CSS and HTML in, which became very useful for later projects such as Senior Design and WebDev. I learned so much about the work it takes for designers to create a front-end that is ideal for all users, which includes getting user feedback, predict user action, and gracefully handle errors.
